### Who is this for?
*Anyone!* Anyone who uses the internet has probably had to create a password protected account at some point, and this
application can help with that. It can simply be used as a place to keep track of all your passwords, or it can help 
create new passwords.


### But why build this?
I've been running into the issue recently where I'm staring at a login screen and have no idea what the password could
be. Sure, Google saves some of my passwords, but there are still a bunch that are only stored at the back of my brain.
With many things moving online, I also have to create new passwords for things and I'm running out of ideas. An app like
this fixes both of these problems!
